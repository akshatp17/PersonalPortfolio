    description: `Developed a single-player 2D platformer in Godot as an experiment to explore game development principles, physics interactions, and level design. This project served as a hands-on learning experience, focusing on scene management, collision handling, and player mechanics within the engine.
    
    The development process involved working with Godotâ€™s scripting language (GDScript) to implement core mechanics, experimenting with tilemaps, object instantiation, and physics-based interactions. Debugging and refining the mechanics provided deeper insights into game state management and optimization.
    
    This project was an important step in understanding Godotâ€™s workflow, reinforcing key concepts in game logic, UI integration, and structured development practices.`,
